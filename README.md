Q1 Assembler, Simulator, and Model
==============================================================================

The Q1 is a computer I designed and built out of discrete transistors.
See http://joewing.net/projects/q1 for more information.

The examples directory contains example programs written in Q1 assembly
language.

The src directory contains the asmq1 and q1sim programs.  asmq1 is the
Q1 assembler and q1sim is the Q1 simulator.

The model directory contains a Verilog model of the Q1 as well as
SPICE models for some of the Q1 circuits.
